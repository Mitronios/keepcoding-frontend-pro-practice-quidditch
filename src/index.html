				About the games
			</h2>
			<p class="font-common mb-2 text-lg">
				The Quidditch World Cup has been held every four years since 1473. The
				competition is held between Quidditch teams representing countries
				around the world.
			</p>
			<p class="font-common mb-2 text-lg">
				The number of participating countries varies from tournament to
				tournament. Any country can enter a team within twelve months of the
				previous final.

				Classification
			</h2>
			<p class="font-common mb-2 text-lg">
				QUALIFICATION Sixteen groups are formed into which the teams are
				divided. Each team plays against all other teams in its group for a
				period of two years. During the group stage, there is a limit of four
				hours of play for each player to prevent exhaustion.
			</p>
			<p class="font-common mb-2 text-lg">
				Because the game ends after four hours of play and the Snitch is not
				caught, the result is decided by goals. A win earns two points. In
				addition to these two points, a win by 150 points earns five points, at
				100 points an extra three points, and at 50 points an extra point.
			</p>
			<p class="font-common mb-2 text-lg">
				If two teams are tied on points, they are separated by whichever team
				catches the Snitch most often or most quickly during their matches. The
				sixteen teams that have finished at the top of the sixteen groups
				qualify for the World Cup.
